## Original Topic

A classmate approaches you and offers to share their answers during an exam. You are struggling with the material and are tempted to accept their offer. What should you do? Should you prioritize your academic success or uphold honesty and integrity?

## Specified Topic

Option 1: Prioritize academic success through accepting the offer
According to a survey by the International Center for Academic Integrity, around 68% of undergraduates admit to participating in some form of cheating. Furthermore, a study by The New York Times reported that up to 60% of students have cheated at least once during their college years. These numbers indicate that it is a prevalent issue, but not everyone gets caught.

Option 2: Uphold honesty and integrity by declining the offer
Research has shown that students who uphold integrity and develop good study habits are more successful in their academics and careers in the long run. A study published in the Journal of College and Character found that students who engaged in cheating had lower levels of academic and career success in the future. Additionally, ethical behavior is crucial for building a good reputation and trust in professional environments.

## Preference Summary

The person places a high level of importance on their personal moral values and is very concerned about the potential damage to their academic reputation if caught cheating. Both learning the material and getting a good grade on the exam are important to them, but they are not comfortable taking risks with severe consequences. Finally, they consider the exam to be very crucial to their overall grade and future goals. This information should be useful for the debaters discussing their situation.
