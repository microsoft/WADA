Leaving the spouse: In the United States, an estimated 50% of marriages end in divorce.

***Proposition :***

> Argument: Leaving an unhealthy relationship can lead to improved mental health, self-awareness, and personal growth.

> Explanation: Leaving a toxic relationship has numerous benefits, including healthier relationships, improved mental health, less anxiety, stress, and hostility, fewer symptoms of depression, lower blood pressure, a stronger immune system, and improved heart health (source). Additionally, leaving an unhealthy relationship can lead to increased self-awareness and self-esteem, which are essential for personal growth.

> Argument: Marriage counseling can lead to improved relationship dynamics and satisfaction.

> Explanation: While leaving an unhealthy relationship may have some benefits, it is important to consider the potential for change and growth within the marriage. Approximately 64% of married couples who opt for marriage counseling report improved dynamics and satisfaction within their relationship (source).

> Argument: Prioritizing personal happiness and mental health is crucial, and leaving an unhealthy relationship may be necessary if counseling is not effective.

> Explanation: While marriage counseling can be beneficial for some couples, it is important to prioritize personal happiness and mental health. In a study involving 1000 couples, 49% said they had attended some form of counseling with their spouse (source). However, the success rate of couples counseling varies, and it may not always lead to a healthier, happier marriage. If counseling is not effective in improving the relationship dynamics and satisfaction, it may be necessary to consider leaving the unhealthy relationship. Prioritizing personal happiness and mental health is crucial for overall well-being, and sometimes, leaving a toxic relationship is the best course of action to achieve that.



***Contradiction :***

> Argument: Commitment and working through adversity can strengthen a marriage and personal growth.

> Argument: Prioritizing personal well-being is essential, and staying in an unhealthy relationship can have negative consequences.

> Explanation: While commitment and working through adversity can strengthen a marriage, it is crucial to prioritize personal well-being. Staying in an unhealthy relationship can have negative effects on mental health, self-esteem, and overall well-being (source).

It is essential to set boundaries and prioritize personal well-being to maintain mental health and foster healthy relationships. If all options, including counseling and working through difficulties, have been explored and the relationship remains unhealthy, it may be necessary to consider leaving the marriage for the sake of personal well-being and happiness.



***Contradiction :***

> Argument: Considering the child's well-being and the potential benefits of staying in a marriage is crucial.

> Explanation: While prioritizing personal well-being is essential, it is also important to consider the well-being of the child involved. Research suggests that children from intact families tend to have strong connections with both parents and exhibit higher levels of emotional stability (source). Furthermore, staying in a marriage can provide a more stable environment for the child, as cohabiting relationships tend to be more fragile than marital relationships (source). It is crucial to weigh the potential benefits of staying in the marriage for the child's well-being against the negative consequences of an unhealthy relationship. Exploring options such as counseling and working through difficulties can help improve the relationship dynamics, which can ultimately benefit both the individual and the child.



***Proposition :***

> Argument: Leaving an unhealthy relationship can provide a healthier environment for the child.

Research has found that children may struggle during the first year or two after a divorce, but many kids bounce back and adapt to the changes in their daily routines and living arrangements (source). Co-parenting, where both parents play an active role in their children's daily lives, is the best way to ensure that all the child's needs are met and enable them to retain close relationships with both parents (source). Staying in an unhealthy relationship can expose the child to frequent conflicts and unhealthy dynamics between their parents, which can Contradictionly impact their emotional stability. Leaving the unhealthy relationship and focusing on effective co-parenting can ultimately benefit both the individual and the child.



***Contradiction :***

> Argument: Working on the marriage and trying counseling can benefit the child's well-being.

> Explanation: While leaving an unhealthy relationship can provide a healthier environment for the child, it is important to consider the potential benefits of working on the marriage for the child's well-being. Co-parenting can be effective, but maintaining a stable and healthy marriage can also provide a secure environment for the child. Research suggests that children from intact families tend to have better self-esteem and adjust more quickly to changes in their living situations (source). Additionally, a 2019 literature review notes that family counseling and other family-based approaches are effective in a variety of situations, including improving relationships between spouses and those between parents and children (source).
