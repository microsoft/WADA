## Debate History


***Proposition :***

> Argument: Pursuing a graduate degree immediately after undergrad can boost your earning potential and career prospects.

>Explanation: Going to graduate school right after completing your undergraduate degree can have several benefits, particularly in the field of marketing. One of the main advantages is the potential for a higher salary upon graduation. A master's degree can boost your earning potential from the moment you graduate, with the national average starting salary for marketing professionals with a master's degree being higher than those with only a bachelor's degree. Additionally, attending graduate school can help you form valuable connections with professors, fellow students, and professionals in the field, which can lead to increased job opportunities upon completion.



***Contradiction :***

> Argument: Gaining work experience first can lead to career progression and better long-term outcomes.

>Explanation: While pursuing a graduate degree immediately after undergrad can boost your earning potential and career prospects, it is important to consider the value of hands-on experience in the marketing field. Gaining work experience first can help you develop practical skills and expertise that are highly valued by employers. As you gain experience, you become qualified for intermediate- or associate-level jobs, which offer more independence and opportunities for growth. Furthermore, many marketing professionals start their careers with a bachelor's degree and advance within the company as they contribute valuable work and gain experience. By prioritizing work experience, you can build a strong foundation for your career and potentially reach managerial positions sooner.



***Proposition :***

> Argument: A graduate degree can provide specialized knowledge and skills that enhance career progression and long-term outcomes.

> Explanation: While gaining work experience is undoubtedly valuable, pursuing a graduate degree in marketing can provide you with specialized knowledge and skills that can set you apart from other candidates in the job market. A master's degree in marketing prepares students to advance their marketing careers or pivot into the marketing field, equipping them with the expertise needed to excel in various marketing roles. Furthermore, the latest BLS data reveals that workers with professional or doctoral degrees had the highest median weekly earnings, indicating that higher education can lead to better long-term financial outcomes. By going to graduate school now, you can gain a competitive edge in the job market and enhance your career progression.



***Contradiction :***

> Argument: Gaining work experience before pursuing a graduate degree can maximize the benefits of higher education.

> Explanation: While a graduate degree can provide specialized knowledge and skills, having work experience before enrolling in a graduate program can enhance the value of your education. Work experience allows you to better understand the practical applications of the theories and concepts taught in graduate school, making your learning experience more meaningful and relevant. Additionally, some graduate programs prefer applicants with a few years of work experience, as it demonstrates growth, discipline, and leadership. By gaining work experience first, you can make the most out of your graduate education and leverage your practical knowledge to excel in both your studies and your career.
