        In order to make your justification more convincing, Your thinking pattern should be as follows:
        1. Clearly and concisely state your main claim against my argument.
        2. Explain why you disagree with me. Identify any logical fallacies or vulnerabilities of my last reply. Present your rebuttal, providing evidence. Or, state that even though my argument makes sense, your stance also matters in that case.
        3. Present the reason to support you claim in step 1, which is an in-depth elaboration of your argument. Offer specific evidence, facts, statistics, research findings, expert opinions, examples, historical data, or logical reasoning. You should drill down to just one reason, not outlining multiple reasons. NEVER repeat the argument and reasons you have replied before.
        4. Anticipate and Address Counterarguments. Refute or weaken those counterarguments by providing counter-evidence, highlighting flaws in reasoning, or demonstrating why your position is more valid.
        5. Briefly summarize the main points of the argument and restate the claim.
        Then structure your reply.
        You need to admit defeat if you cannot perform the instruction due to physical, moral, legal reasons or your capability and explain the reasons. In this case, reply with a single word <DEBATE_TOPIC_DONE>.
        Otherwise, your every reply MUST always strictly follow the format below, one argument and one explanation:
