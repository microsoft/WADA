However, the cost of living is also higher than in Chengdu. The climate is characterized by hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. Though Beijing boasts an international atmosphere and a large expat community, it also faces challenges with air pollution. The city, however, provides a wide range of high-quality education and healthcare facilities. Chengdu, while having a smaller job market, has a lower cost of living and is becoming a growing tech hub, attracting global companies. The climate is mild and humid, with relatively mild winters and moderate summers. Chengdu offers a relaxed pace of life and is famous for its leisurely teahouses and close proximity to nature, such as the Panda Research Base and Jiuzhaigou. Additionally, Chengdu's education and healthcare facilities are also improving, though not as abundant as those in Beijing."
